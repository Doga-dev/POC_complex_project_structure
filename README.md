# POC_complex_project_structure

This is to test a complex project structure using:
- CMAKE 
- Qt5.15
- QtQuick

with some shared libraries like:
- GUI (graphical components and fonts)
- ConfigManager
- LogManager
- UserManager
- Communication
- PluginManager

and some plugins to extend available functions of the application. Each plugin can need and use the available libraries in the project
